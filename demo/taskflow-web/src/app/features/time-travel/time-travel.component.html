      <p>Time travel allows you to reconstruct the state of any aggregate at any version by replaying events up to that point.</p>

      <h3>Key Event Sourcing Concepts:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Replay</strong> - Reconstruct past state by replaying stored events</li>
        <li><strong>Audit Trail</strong> - Complete history of all changes and who made them</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Queries</strong> - Answer questions about the past ("What was the project status on January 15th?")</li>
        <li><strong>Event Versioning</strong> - Navigate through aggregate versions as events were applied</li>
        <li><strong>State Snapshots</strong> - View the exact state at any event boundary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>View project state at any historical version</li>
        <li>See work item changes over time</li>
        <li>Inspect team composition at different points</li>
        <li>Understand how aggregates evolved</li>
        <li>Debug issues by replaying event sequences</li>
      </ul>
